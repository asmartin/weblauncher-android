Simple Computer Remote
====================

This is the project page for the "Simple Computer Remote" Android application.

### Donations
I do not ask for donations but if you want to do a "buy me a beer" donation, send it via Google Wallet to philliptproctor@gmail.com

### Code
The 'Android' directory contains all of the java code for the Android client application. Likewise, the 'Host' directory contains
the code for all of the host applications. The host is programmed in Golang to reduce code redundancy, but this does come with some
limitations. There is also some C code used for the platform specific bindings for mouse and keyboard control.

All code contributions are welcome.
